I am a driven and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to AI technologies.

After graduating from Nottingham University with a BA in History and an MSc in IT Management, I spent four years working for a professional services company in the Risk Assurance department. This gave me exposure to a wide variety of business's as well as enabling me to become a chartered accountant. On completion of my qualification, I decided to redirect my career and was accepted into Makers Academy - one of the most discerning development bootcamps in the world.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, ACL, SQLite

## Skills

#### Thrives under pressure

From working in a regulatory environment with tight reporting deadlines across multiple teams, where we were simultaneously required to pass 15 exams, to completing [group projects](#projects). I have always been energised by focused environments. It is my ability to remain calm, prioritise tasks and be effective with my time that enables me to do this.


#### Challenge orientated

Whether it's automating analysis on legacy, unsupported, undocumented systems (I'm looking at you Access Horizons!), hitch-hiking to Morocco or training for a triathlon, if a task is difficult but worthwhile I want to be part of the team that tackles it. The more difficult the problem and the more terse it's solution, the better.


#### Excellent communicator

Whilst at PwC I gained significant experience coaching and training junior team members, advising clients on appropriate and often complex accounting treatments, as well as providing tailored information to senior team members in the form of budgets and status reports. This experience has ingrained in me the ability to communicate clearly and with consideration of the wider context.

#### Growth mentality

In order to enhance my abilities as a developer, I am committed to building my knowledge. To this end I am working my way through [these books](https://github.com/TomJamesDuffy/booklist), reaching out to established developers and regularly attending [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/Codecademy-London/events/246589710/). To further my interest in AI I am undertaking the following two courses in [machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and [neural networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning). I am also [building my own projects](https://github.com/TomJamesDuffy/Risk-Simulation).
