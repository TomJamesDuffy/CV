I am a driven and ambitious **Full Stack Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to new technologies.

After graduating from The University of Nottingham with an MSc in IT Management, I spent four years working for PwC in the Risk Assurance department. This gave me exposure to a range of business' as well as enabling me to become a chartered accountant. On completion of my qualification, I decided to redirect my career and was accepted into Makers Academy - a discerning development bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Challenge orientated

Constantly testing my ability and pushing myself is embedded into who I am. At PwC this resulted in me interviewing and being chosen to work on a competitive team that was looking at international data flows at Deutsche Bank. In my spare time this has resulted in me hitch-hiking to Morocco, running a marathon, graduating from a martial arts school in China and committing to an upcoming 7 hour quadrathlon.

#### Excellent communicator

Whilst at PwC I gained significant experience coaching junior team members, as well as providing tailored information to more senior individuals in the form of budgets and status reports. Communicating effectively with clients was also critical as often I was required to advise on complex accounting treatments.  These experiences have ingrained within me the ability to communicate with clarity and consideration of the wider context.

#### Thrives under pressure

When the pressure is high, I find myself energised and focused. My work at PwC reflected this, as I was not only operating in a highly regulated environment with tight reporting deadlines, but I was also assigned to multiple teams at once and studying for my ACA qualification.

#### Growth mentality

In order to continuously enhance my abilities as a developer, I am committed to developing my learning process and building my knowledge. In order to do this more effectively, I am engaging with the Ruby community, reading around the languages and frameworks I am working with and also making an effort to always be learning something new.
